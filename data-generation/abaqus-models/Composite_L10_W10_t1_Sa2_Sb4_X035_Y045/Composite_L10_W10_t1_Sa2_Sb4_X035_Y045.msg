  Typically a zero pivot is associated with an overconstraint in the model. 
 However, Abaqus was not able to identify any chains of constraints that might 
 lead to an overconstraint at this node. This suggests that the model might be 
 in fact insufficiently constrained in this particular degree of freedom. 
 Please check the constraints used in this model.
